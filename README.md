This code is for the mathematical optimization model of article "Cost-Competitive Offshore Wind-Powered Green Methanol Production for Maritime Transport Decarbonization", which was published in Nature Communications: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60608-5. 
Before letting the code run, Matlab, Yalmip, Gurobi, and the integration between them is necessary.
Scenarios 1 to 4 correspond to the system optimization configuration using Rotterdam Port in the Netherlands as an example.
